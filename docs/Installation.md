# Installation

You need to prepare your machine to continue the workshop. Don't worry, it is quite straightforward!

- First, you need [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) or [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed on your machine and up to date. This program will install all NodeJS dependencies. I assume for the rest of the workshop that you use Yarn, but the commands are really similar for NPM.

- You also need a code editor. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is great but you can pick your favorite. Just make sure that Elm is supported, and the you can reformat the code automatically. The `elm-format` is very powerful and used for **all** Elm files on the web. You should use it.

- You need to clone the skeleton on your own Github to push your work. Follow this [link](https://github.com/NicolasGuilloux/elm-workshop/generate) to use the template. Makes sure the checkbox "Copy all branches" is checked to copy the `gh-pages` branch aswell.

- Clone your new repository on your machine, open the folder with your favorite editor, and you're good to go!


If you didn't join the [Elm Slack](https://elmlang.herokuapp.com/), please do. There are some amazing people who will help you if you are stuck somewhere.

Now that everything is setup correctly, lets begin!
