# Elm dashboard for Firefox and Chromium

This is an [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/) project to learn the basis by making a beautiful dashboard for your favorite webbrowser.

A good example is the extension [Momemtum](https://momentumdash.com/). This will be our base. The goal is to build an extension for Chromium or Firefox to customize the "New tab" page with a beautiful random background, the weather, some links and of course the centrale clock.

Thanks to Github Action and Pages, we can build the assets of our master branch and push it to the `gh-pages` branch to make it available from a link: https://nicolasguilloux.github.io/elm-workshop/

This workshop covers the basis of Elm. If you are stuck, you can ask me by creating an issue, I would be glad to answer. Moreover, note that Elm has a very active Slack. A lot of people are there to help you and solve all your troubles. I guess this is the first step of the workshop: [join the Elm Slack](https://elmlang.herokuapp.com/).
