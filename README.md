# Elm dashboard for Firefox and Chromium

This is an [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/) project to learn the basis by making a beautiful dashboard for your favorite webbrowser.

A good example is the extension [Momemtum](https://momentumdash.com/). This will be our base. The goal is to build an extension for Chromium or Firefox to customize the "New tab" page with a beautiful random background, the weather, some links and of course the centrale clock.

Thanks to Github Action and Pages, we can build the assets of our master branch and push it to the `gh-pages` branch to make it available from a link: https://nicolasguilloux.github.io/elm-workshop/


## Installation

The only thing you need is `yarn` installed on your machine and up to date. This is the only dependency as it will install everything we need, especially Elm.


## Features

This is a list of all features that we will bring to our extension.

 - A clock
 - A random welcome message
 - The weather
